## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
Data Inputs: Soil health, weather data, farmer preferences.
AI Advisory Engine: Personalized crop selection, irrigation/fertilizer schedule, pest/disease alerts, market-based suggestions.
Farmer Access:
  Mobile App (local language, visuals, chatbot).
  IVR/Voice calls + SMS for non-smartphone users.
  Extra Features: Govt. scheme alerts, mandi prices, community knowledge sharing.
Benefits:
  Improves yield & income.
  Reduces crop failure risk.
  Inclusive for small & marginal farmers.
  Scalable & low-cost with NGO/Govt. support.

## Technical Approach
 Data Collection: Collect data on soil, weather, crop health, and market trends through:
    - IoT sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity)
    - Satellite imaging (crop health, weather patterns)
    - Farmer inputs (crop type, growth stage, pest/disease issues)
2. Data Analysis: Analyze collected data using:
    - Machine learning algorithms (predictive modeling, anomaly detection)
    - Crop models (simulate crop growth, predict yields)
    - Weather forecasting (predict weather patterns, provide alerts)
3. Advisory Generation: Generate personalized crop advisories based on analyzed data, including:
    - Irrigation scheduling
    - Fertilizer and pesticide application
    - Pest and disease management
    - Harvesting and post-harvest management
4. Delivery Mechanism: Deliver advisories to farmers through:
    - Mobile apps (push notifications, personalized recommendations)
    - SMS alerts
    - Voice-based systems (IVR, voice assistants)

Technical Requirements:
1. Cloud Infrastructure: Scalable cloud infrastructure for data storage, processing, and analysis.
2. Data Integration: Integrate data from various sources (IoT sensors, satellite imaging, farmer inputs).
3. Machine Learning: Develop and train machine learning models for predictive analytics.
4. API Development: Develop APIs for data exchange between systems and delivery mechanisms.

## Feasibility and Viability
 Increased Crop Yields: The system provides personalized crop recommendations, real-time weather alerts, and soil health insights, leading to improved crop yields and reduced losses.
- Resource Efficiency: By optimizing irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticide use, farmers can reduce waste and minimize environmental impact.
- Accessibility: The system's user-friendly interface and multilingual support make it accessible to farmers with varying levels of literacy and technical expertise.
- Scalability: Cloud-based infrastructure and scalable architecture enable the system to reach a large number of farmers.
- Affordability: Flexible pricing plans, starting at $10-20 per month, make the system an affordable solution for small and marginal farmers.

## Impact and Benefits
Benefits
- Increased Crop Yields: Smart crop advisory systems can boost yields by up to 20-30% by providing personalized recommendations and optimizing resource usage.
- Water Conservation: Real-time soil moisture monitoring and smart irrigation systems can reduce water waste by up to 50%.
- Improved Resource Efficiency: Targeted fertilizer and pesticide application guided by sensor data can reduce input waste and minimize environmental impact.
- Enhanced Decision-Making: Data-driven insights enable farmers to make informed decisions, reducing guesswork and improving crop management.
- Cost Savings: Efficient resource management and reduced input costs lead to significant cost savings for farmers.
- Sustainability: Smart farming practices promote environmental sustainability by minimizing waste, reducing chemical use, and conserving resources.
Impact on Farmers
- Increased Profitability: By optimizing crop yields and reducing waste, farmers can increase their income and profitability.
- Better Risk Management: Smart crop advisory systems can help farmers anticipate and mitigate risks associated with weather, pests, and diseases.
- Improved Crop Quality: Personalized recommendations and precise application of inputs can lead to better crop quality and reduced losses.
